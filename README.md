# MaxestFramework

My C++ framework on which I experiment with various things, mostly pertaining to real-time rendering. It features a bunch of real-time rendering demos implemented using Direct3D 11. The demos depict effects like temporal anti-aliasing, screen-space ambient occlusion and my novel contact-hardening soft shadows implementation, among other things.
